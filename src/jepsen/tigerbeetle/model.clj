  "A state machine model of TigerBeetle's semantics.

  ## Timestamps

  We have to keep advancing timestamps in the model itself, and record those
  timestamps in the records we store. However, the timestamps computed by
  TigerBeetle are impure--they are driven not only by monotonic advancing
  indices, but also by the leader's wall clock. We do not, in general, have
  access to these timestamps--they are not returned in the response to (e.g.)
  create-accounts, and even if they were, we may not *have* that response.

  We could try to infer lower bounds on timestamps and advance them once
  observed, but we can actually be more precise by punting. We require that our
  caller provide us with a map of account (transfer) ID to timestamp. We can do
  this because our histories *always* require a complete read of every account
  and transfer."

  Two facts:

  1. We have to do range queries & ordering on timestamps
  2. Each timestamp uniquely identifies a single transfer or account.

  This lets us do something cute. We store our secondary indices using
  Bifurcan integer maps of timestamp-id. These maps give us efficient
  union, intersection, slice, and ordered traversal by timestamp. Moreover,
  integer comparison is much faster than comparing the full transfer or
  account objects. So each index is a map of, say, `debit account id` ->
  `timestamp` -> `id`.

  Why store ids instead of transfers or account directly? Accounts are partly

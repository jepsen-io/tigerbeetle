  "Generates operations for the transfer workload. This is a giant mess of
  monads, so we're breaking it out into its own namespace.

  General goals:

  - Generate *mostly* logically :ok events. Logical errors like
  :exceeds-credits are fine and tell us something, but they don't change state,
  and changing state is the name of the game.

  - Heavy concurrency on some accounts. Not sure if we actually want low
  concurrency or not.

  - Reads of mostly recent accounts/transfers. Occasional reads of older
  accounts.

  - Continually adding accounts.

  The name of the game, as usual, is exponential distributions. We're going to
  create accounts continuously throughout the test and maintain an ordered list
  of them. When selecting accounts for transfers/reads, we'll take an
  exponential distribution over accounts. We'll order that distribution by
  *hashmap* order, which means that some accounts get hot access, and others
  are cooler, and newly created accounts can be either hot or cool."

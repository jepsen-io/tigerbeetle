  "Transfers and accounts go through several phases during the course of a
  test. When we attempt to create something, we call it *possible*. When not
  yet observed, we call it *unseen*. Once observed, we call it *seen*. There is
  a very good chance that many of our possible, unseen records do not actually
  exist--for instance, if the op returns :fail, or the result of that
  individual record is an error like :linked-event-failed, or we try to read it
  and do not see it. We call these records *unlikely*, and other unseen records
  *likely*. When trying to read and update objects, we want to focus our
  efforts mainly on the seen and likely ones, not the unlikely ones."
